# Makers Twitter Spring Boot Seed

You can use this seed to get started building a Twitter clone.

It comes set up with:

* The JUnit5 test framework.
* The Spring Boot web framework.
* The PostgreSQL database.
* The JPA ORM
* The Thymeleaf view templating system.

Posting and listing tweets is already implemented and commented.

## Quickstart

First create the databases.

```shell
; createdb makers-twitter-clone-dev
; createdb makers-twitter-clone-test
```

Then open this directory using IntelliJ. You may need to wait for
the dependencies to install.

Then, in the Gradle sidebar:

* To run the tests: `Twitter -> Tasks -> Verification -> Test`
* To run the server: `Twitter -> Tasks -> Application -> bootRun`

If you encounter any problems, they are not intended. Contact your coach for advice.
